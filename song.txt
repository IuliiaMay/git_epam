I heard she sang a good song,
I heard she had a style.
And so I came to see her
And listen for a while.
And there she was this young girl,
A stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with her fingers,
Singing my life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song,
Killing me softly with her song,
Telling my whole life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song
